HOW TO CHECK IF TRAINING IS RUNNING
================================================================================

YOU SAID: No log files in lstm_training folder

CORRECTION: The log file is in a DIFFERENT location!

CORRECT LOG FILE LOCATION:
  logs\screening\lstm_training.log

NOT HERE:
  logs\lstm_training\  ❌ (This folder might not even exist)

================================================================================
HOW TO CHECK TRAINING STATUS (While It's Running)
================================================================================

METHOD 1: Check the Log File (Best Option)
-------------------------------------------
Open a NEW command prompt (don't close the training one):

cd C:\Users\david\AOSS
type logs\screening\lstm_training.log

This will show you everything that's happening!

To watch it update live (refreshes every 2 seconds):
  cmd /c "for /L %i in (1,0,2) do @(cls & type logs\screening\lstm_training.log & timeout /t 2 /nobreak >nul)"

Or simpler (one-time check):
  type logs\screening\lstm_training.log

METHOD 2: Check Task Manager
-----------------------------
1. Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc
2. Go to "Details" tab
3. Find "python.exe" 
4. Look at CPU column:
   
   IF CPU is 20-80%: ✅ Training is running!
   IF CPU is 0-5%:   ⚠️ Might be stuck or waiting for data
   IF no python.exe: ❌ Process crashed or finished

METHOD 3: Check Process List (Command Line)
--------------------------------------------
Open another command prompt:
  tasklist | findstr python

If you see python.exe listed: ✅ Still running
If you don't see it: ❌ Process finished or crashed

================================================================================
WHAT THE LOG FILE WILL SHOW
================================================================================

If Training is Running:
-----------------------
2025-11-08 06:16:55 - __main__ - INFO - LSTM Trainer initialized
2025-11-08 06:16:55 - __main__ - INFO - Starting LSTM training for CBA.AX...
2025-11-08 06:16:55 - train_lstm - INFO - Starting LSTM training for CBA.AX
2025-11-08 06:16:56 - train_lstm - INFO - Fetching training data for CBA.AX
2025-11-08 06:17:03 - train_lstm - INFO - Fetched 500 days of data for CBA.AX
2025-11-08 06:17:04 - train_lstm - INFO - Training on 8 features: [...]

Then you'll see training progress (this takes 5-20 minutes)

If Training Completed:
----------------------
2025-11-08 06:25:45 - train_lstm - INFO - Training complete for CBA.AX
2025-11-08 06:25:45 - __main__ - INFO - ✅ CBA.AX: Training completed in 512s
2025-11-08 06:25:45 - __main__ - INFO -    Loss: 0.0045
2025-11-08 06:25:45 - __main__ - INFO -    Val Loss: 0.0052

If Training Failed:
-------------------
2025-11-08 06:16:55 - __main__ - ERROR - ❌ CBA.AX: Training failed
2025-11-08 06:16:55 - __main__ - ERROR -    Error: [error message]

================================================================================
COMMANDS TO RUN RIGHT NOW
================================================================================

In a NEW command prompt (keep training window open):

Command 1: Check if log file exists
------------------------------------
cd C:\Users\david\AOSS
dir logs\screening\lstm_training.log

Expected: Should show the file with today's date

Command 2: View the log
------------------------
type logs\screening\lstm_training.log

Expected: Shows training progress

Command 3: Check if Python is running
--------------------------------------
tasklist | findstr python

Expected: Shows "python.exe" if training is running

Command 4: Check CPU usage (Task Manager)
------------------------------------------
Press Ctrl+Shift+Esc
Look for python.exe in Details tab
Check CPU percentage

Expected: 20-80% CPU if training is running

================================================================================
WHAT IF LOG FILE DOESN'T EXIST?
================================================================================

If logs\screening\lstm_training.log doesn't exist:

Possibility 1: Training hasn't started yet
  - Check if python.exe is running
  - Wait another minute

Possibility 2: Wrong directory structure
  - Check if logs folder exists: dir logs
  - Check if screening subfolder exists: dir logs\screening
  - If missing, training might have crashed before creating them

Possibility 3: Training crashed immediately
  - Python process is not running
  - Error happened before logging started
  - Check the command window for error messages

Possibility 4: Training process stuck at startup
  - Python process is running (0% CPU)
  - Stuck downloading data or initializing
  - Wait 2-3 more minutes, then Ctrl+C and retry

================================================================================
DIAGNOSIS FLOWCHART
================================================================================

START: Training window shows blinking cursor
         ↓
Q1: Does logs\screening\lstm_training.log exist?
    ├─ YES → Read it: type logs\screening\lstm_training.log
    │         ├─ Shows training progress → ✅ Working! Be patient.
    │         ├─ Shows error message → ❌ Failed, read error
    │         └─ Shows "Fetching data" → ⏳ Still downloading data
    │
    └─ NO → Check if python.exe is running: tasklist | findstr python
              ├─ YES (process exists) → Check CPU usage
              │    ├─ 20-80% CPU → ✅ Training starting, wait for log
              │    └─ 0-5% CPU → ⚠️ Stuck, wait 2 min then Ctrl+C
              │
              └─ NO (process doesn't exist) → ❌ Crashed or finished
                   Check training window for error messages

================================================================================
COMMON SCENARIOS AFTER 4 MINUTES
================================================================================

Scenario 1: Log file shows "Fetching data..."
----------------------------------------------
Status: ✅ NORMAL - Downloading from Yahoo Finance
Action: Wait 2-3 more minutes
Why: Network speed dependent, can be slow

Scenario 2: Log file shows "Training on 8 features"
----------------------------------------------------
Status: ✅ NORMAL - Training in progress
Action: Wait 10-15 more minutes
Why: Training 50 epochs takes time

Scenario 3: Log file shows epoch progress (Epoch X/50)
-------------------------------------------------------
Status: ✅ EXCELLENT - Training is working!
Action: Wait until Epoch 50/50
Why: This is the main training phase

Scenario 4: Log file doesn't exist
-----------------------------------
Status: ⚠️ NEEDS INVESTIGATION
Action: Check if python.exe is running
Why: Process might have crashed or stuck

Scenario 5: Log file shows error
---------------------------------
Status: ❌ FAILED
Action: Read the error message
Why: Something went wrong, needs fixing

================================================================================

2025-11-08 06:17:04 - INFO - Training on 8 features: [...]
[Training epoch progress would show here]

At 4 minutes (your current time):
----------------------------------
[Should show several epochs completed]
Epoch 10/50 or similar

At 15 minutes:
--------------

2025-11-08 06:25:45 - INFO - ✅ CBA.AX: Training completed

================================================================================
YOUR NEXT STEP
================================================================================

RIGHT NOW, do this:

1. Open a NEW command prompt (keep training window open)

2. Run this command:
   cd C:\Users\david\AOSS
   type logs\screening\lstm_training.log

3. Read the output and tell me what you see

This will tell us EXACTLY what's happening!

Possible results:
  ✅ "Fetched 500 days of data" → Training is running normally
  ✅ "Epoch X/50" → Training is working, be patient
  ⚠️ "Fetching training data" → Still downloading, wait
  ❌ Error message → Training failed, we'll fix it
  ❌ File not found → Process crashed or stuck

Once you check the log, you'll know exactly what's happening!
