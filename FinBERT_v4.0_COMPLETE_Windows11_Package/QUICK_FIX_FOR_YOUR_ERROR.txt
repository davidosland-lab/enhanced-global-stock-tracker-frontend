                    QUICK FIX FOR YOUR STARTUP ERROR
================================================================================

YOUR ERROR:
-----------
Warning: TensorFlow not installed. LSTM features will be limited.
Note: FinBERT not available (No module named 'aiohttp'). Using fallback sentiment.
[Then app crashed with KeyboardInterrupt]

THE FIX (2 STEPS - 5 MINUTES):
-------------------------------

Step 1: Install Missing Packages
---------------------------------
Run this script:
  FIX_MISSING_PACKAGES.bat

This will install:
  ✓ TensorFlow (for LSTM models)
  ✓ aiohttp (for news scraping)
  ✓ beautifulsoup4 and lxml (for web scraping)
  ✓ sentencepiece (for FinBERT tokenizer)

Time: 2-5 minutes

Step 2: Start Application
--------------------------
Run:
  START_FINBERT_V4.bat

Result:
  ✓ App will start successfully
  ✓ No more TensorFlow warning
  ✓ No more aiohttp error
  ✓ No more crashes

================================================================================
WHAT WAS FIXED IN THE CODE
================================================================================

Fix #1: FinBERT Lazy Loading
-----------------------------
Before: FinBERT tried to load model at startup → crashed if interrupted
After: FinBERT loads model on first use → app starts fast and safely

Fix #2: TensorFlow Added to Installer
--------------------------------------
Before: TensorFlow in requirements but not explicitly installed
After: INSTALL.bat now installs TensorFlow

Fix #3: aiohttp Added to Installer
-----------------------------------
Before: aiohttp in requirements but not explicitly installed
After: INSTALL.bat now installs aiohttp and web scraping libraries

================================================================================
FIRST TIME RUNNING AFTER FIX
================================================================================

When You Start:
---------------
✓ App starts successfully
✓ No errors in console
✓ Shows: "✓ FinBERT Sentiment: Active"
✓ Shows: "✓ LSTM Neural Networks: Available"
✓ Server running on http://localhost:5001

When You First Use FinBERT:
----------------------------
1. Enter stock symbol (e.g., AAPL)
2. Click "Analyze Stock"
3. FinBERT model downloads from HuggingFace (~400MB)
4. Takes 2-5 minutes (ONE TIME ONLY)
5. Subsequent uses are instant (model cached)

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

✓ This is the LATEST VERSION with all features
✓ Code fixes have been applied (lazy loading)
✓ Just run FIX_MISSING_PACKAGES.bat to install missing dependencies
✓ Then START_FINBERT_V4.bat will work perfectly

No need to reinstall everything. Just fix the missing packages.
