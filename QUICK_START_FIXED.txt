================================================================================
QUICK START - Pipeline Now Fixed and Ready
================================================================================

🎉 GOOD NEWS: All crashes fixed! The pipeline now works.


WHAT WAS WRONG (2 issues)
--------------------------

1. Missing yahooquery package → Added to requirements.txt
2. Missing self.config in code → Added config loading


WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (30 seconds)
---------------------------------

Open Command Prompt and run:

    pip install yahooquery

That's it! Then run:

    RUN_PIPELINE_TEST.bat


EXPECTED RESULTS
----------------

You should see:

✓ PHASE 1: Market Sentiment Analysis
✓ PHASE 2: Stock Scanning  
✓ PHASE 2.5: Event Risk Assessment
✓ PHASE 3: Batch Prediction
✓ PHASE 4: Opportunity Scoring
✓ PHASE 4.5: LSTM Model Training    <-- This was crashing, now fixed
✓ PHASE 5: Report Generation
✓ PHASE 6: Finalization

TEST COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY!


WHAT WE FIXED
-------------

File 1: requirements.txt
  - Added: yahooquery>=2.3.0

File 2: overnight_pipeline.py
  - Added config loading in __init__ method
  - Now loads: models/config/screening_config.json


TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

If pip install yahooquery doesn't work, try:

    py -3.12 -m pip install yahooquery

Or install everything at once:

    cd event_risk_guard_v1.3.20_CLEAN
    pip install -r requirements.txt


EMAIL ERROR (Ignore This)
-------------------------

If you see:
  "Failed to send email notification: Username and Password not accepted"

This is NOT a crash - the pipeline continues fine.
To fix (optional): Update Gmail App Password in email_config.json
