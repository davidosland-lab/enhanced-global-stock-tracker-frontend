## 🔢 How Sentiment Scoring Works

### Score Range: 0.0 to 1.0

| Score Range | Interpretation | Trading Signal | Market Condition |
|------------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| 0.70 - 1.00 | VERY BULLISH | Strong Buy | Highly favorable across all factors |
| 0.60 - 0.69 | BULLISH | Buy | Positive sentiment with good backdrop |
| 0.40 - 0.59 | NEUTRAL | Hold | Mixed signals, no clear direction |
| 0.30 - 0.39 | BEARISH | Reduce/Sell | Negative sentiment emerging |
| 0.00 - 0.29 | VERY BEARISH | Strong Sell | Multiple risk factors present |

## 💡 Real-World Examples

### Example 1: War/Conflict Detection
When Russia-Ukraine tensions escalate:
- VIX spikes above 30 → Sentiment drops by 0.2
- Gold rises 2% in 5 days → Flight to safety detected
- Global indices decline in coordination → Additional negative signal
- **Result**: Sentiment score drops to 0.3 (BEARISH)

### Example 2: Fed Rate Announcement
When Fed signals rate cuts:
- 10-Year yield falls 5% → Positive for stocks
- Yield curve normalizes → Recession fears reduce
- Financial sector rallies → Economic confidence
- **Result**: Sentiment score rises to 0.65 (BULLISH)

### Example 3: Strong Earnings Season
When 80% of S&P 500 beat earnings:
- Earnings beat ratio at 0.8 → Strong positive
- Revenue growth positive → Economic strength
- Forward guidance raised → Future optimism
- **Result**: Sentiment score reaches 0.72 (VERY BULLISH)

## 🚀 Impact on ML Predictions

The sentiment score affects predictions in several ways:

1. **Signal Enhancement**
   - Bullish sentiment (>0.6) can upgrade HOLD to BUY
   - Bearish sentiment (<0.4) can upgrade HOLD to SELL

2. **Confidence Adjustment**
   - Strong sentiment alignment increases prediction confidence
   - Conflicting sentiment reduces confidence scores

3. **Risk Management**
   - Very bearish sentiment (<0.3) triggers risk reduction
   - Very bullish sentiment (>0.7) allows larger positions
