## üíª Manual Installation (Advanced Users)

If the batch file doesn't work, you can install manually:

```powershell
# Open PowerShell or Command Prompt

# 1. Navigate to the extracted folder
cd C:\MLCore\ML_Core_Windows_Deployment

# 2. Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# 3. Activate virtual environment
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# 4. Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 5. Run the system
python ml_core_enhanced_production.py
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Python Not Found
- Ensure Python 3.9+ is installed
- Add Python to PATH (System Environment Variables)
- Restart Command Prompt after installation

### Package Installation Fails
- Check internet connection
- Try using administrator privileges
- Install packages one by one manually

### TA-Lib Installation (Optional)
TA-Lib requires special installation on Windows:
1. Download the appropriate wheel from: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#ta-lib
2. Install using: `pip install TA_Lib-0.4.28-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl`
3. The system works without it using fallback calculations

### Port 8000 Already in Use
- Change the port in `ml_core_enhanced_production.py`
- Look for: `uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)`
- Change to: `uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)`

## üìä Using the System

### Training a Model
```python
POST http://localhost:8000/api/train
{
    "symbol": "AAPL",
    "ensemble_type": "voting",
    "days": 480
}
```

### Running Backtest
```python
POST http://localhost:8000/api/backtest
{
    "symbol": "AAPL",
    "start_date": "2024-01-01",
    "end_date": "2024-12-31"
}
```

### Getting Predictions
```python
POST http://localhost:8000/api/predict
{
    "symbol": "AAPL"
}
```

## üîê Security Notes

- The system runs locally on your machine
- No data is sent to external servers (except market data from Yahoo Finance)
- All models and predictions are stored locally
- Use firewall rules if exposing to network

---

## üìà Performance Tips

1. **First Run**: Initial data fetch may take longer
2. **Cache**: System gets faster with use (SQLite caching)
3. **RAM**: Close other applications for better performance
4. **CPU**: Training uses multiple cores automatically

---

## üÜò Support

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue**: "Python is not recognized"
**Solution**: Reinstall Python with "Add to PATH" checked

**Issue**: "Module not found" errors
**Solution**: Activate virtual environment first

**Issue**: System runs slowly
**Solution**: Increase available RAM, close other applications

**Issue**: Cannot connect to localhost:8000
**Solution**: Check Windows Firewall, ensure no other service uses port 8000
