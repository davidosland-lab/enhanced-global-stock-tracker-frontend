```
This will identify all issues and save a detailed report.

### Step 2: Apply Quick Fix
```batch
QUICK_FIX.bat
```
This will attempt to automatically resolve common issues.

### Step 3: Test Individual Services
```batch
TEST_INDIVIDUAL.bat
```
Test each service separately to identify specific failures.

### Step 4: Monitor Services
```batch
SERVICE_MONITOR.bat
```
Monitor services in real-time to see which are running.

### Step 5: Try Alternative Startup
If regular START.bat fails, try:
```batch
START_POWERSHELL.bat
```

## üîß Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Virtual environment not found"
**Solution**: Run `INSTALL.bat` to create and set up the virtual environment

### Issue: "Port already in use"
**Solution**: Run `QUICK_FIX.bat` which will free up the ports

### Issue: "Package not found"
**Solution**: 
1. Run `QUICK_FIX.bat` to auto-install missing packages
2. Or manually: `venv\Scripts\activate` then `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Issue: "SSL certificate error"
**Solution**: `QUICK_FIX.bat` clears SSL environment variables automatically

### Issue: "Access denied" or permission errors
**Solution**: Run Command Prompt as Administrator

### Issue: Services start but immediately stop
**Solution**: 
1. Run `TEST_INDIVIDUAL.bat` to see exact error
2. Check `diagnostic_results` folder for detailed logs

## üìä Understanding Diagnostic Output

### Green ‚úì = Working correctly
### Yellow ‚ö† = Warning, may need attention
### Red ‚úó = Error, needs to be fixed

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Always run diagnostic first** - It will tell you exactly what's wrong
2. **Save diagnostic reports** - Keep them for reference
3. **Use Service Monitor** - Leave it running to watch service health
4. **Try PowerShell startup** - Often more reliable than batch files
5. **Check firewall/antivirus** - They may block Python or network ports

## üìÅ Diagnostic Files Generated

- `diagnostic_results/` - Folder containing all diagnostic reports
- `diagnostic_report_[timestamp].txt` - Detailed system analysis
- Test database files (`.db`) - Created during testing

## üÜò If All Else Fails

1. Delete the `venv` folder completely
2. Run `INSTALL.bat` to recreate environment
3. Run `FULL_DIAGNOSTIC.bat` to verify
4. Run `START.bat` or `START_POWERSHELL.bat`

## üìß Information to Share for Support

If you need help, run `FULL_DIAGNOSTIC.bat` and share:
1. The generated report file
2. Your Python version (`python --version`)
3. Your Windows version
4. Any error messages you see
