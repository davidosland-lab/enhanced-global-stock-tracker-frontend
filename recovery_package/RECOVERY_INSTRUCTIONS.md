# ðŸš¨ MARKET TRACKER RECOVERY - RESTORING CORRECT VERSION

## The Problem
Your Market Tracker was replaced with a completely different version that:
- Lost the 24hr/48hr time period buttons
- Lost the ASX/FTSE/S&P 500 market cards
- Lost the historical data tracking
- Shows a blank "No data available" screen

## This Recovery Package Contains
The CORRECT Market Tracker with:
- âœ… **24 Hour / 48 Hour buttons** (Last 24 Hours | 48h From 10:00 Yesterday)
- âœ… **Three Market Cards**: ASX/AORD, FTSE 100, S&P 500
- âœ… **Live price updates** with color-coded changes
- âœ… **Market status indicators** (Open/Closed)
- âœ… **Combined chart** showing all three markets
- âœ… **Auto-refresh** every 30 seconds
- âœ… **FIXED API URL** for file:// protocol

## Installation Instructions

1. **Backup your current files** (optional but recommended)

2. **Copy the Market Tracker:**
   - Copy `market_tracker_final_correct.html` to:
   - `C:\StockTrack\clean_install_v6\modules\market-tracking\`
   - This will restore the CORRECT version with all features

3. **Update the Landing Page:**
   - Copy `index.html` to:
   - `C:\StockTrack\clean_install_v6\`
   - This updates the link to use the correct Market Tracker

4. **Clear Browser Cache:**
   - Press `Ctrl + F5` when viewing the Market Tracker
   - Or use `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` and clear cached files

## What This Restores

### Market Cards Display:
- ASX/AORD with trading hours 10:00-16:00 AEST
- FTSE 100 with trading hours 18:00-02:30 AEST
- S&P 500 with trading hours 00:30-07:00 AEST

### Time Period Controls:
- "Last 24 Hours" button - Shows past 24 hours of data
- "48h (From 10:00 Yesterday)" - Shows 48 hours starting from yesterday's market open

### Visual Features:
- Red/Green color coding for price changes
- Market open/closed status badges
- Combined performance chart
- Auto-updating timestamp

## Verification
After installation, your Market Tracker should show:
1. Three market cards at the top (ASX, FTSE, S&P)
2. Two time period buttons below the header
3. A combined chart showing all markets
4. Live price updates (if backend is running)

## Technical Note
The API_BASE has been hardcoded to `http://localhost:8002` to work with file:// protocol, fixing the "Failed to fetch" issue when opening files locally.
