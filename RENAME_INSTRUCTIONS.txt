IMPORTANT: After extracting the package:

1. RENAME the Python file:
   From: unified_stock_CLEAN.py
   To:   unified_stock_final.py

2. Edit START_FINAL.bat to change the filename:
   Change: python unified_stock_final.py
   To remain as is (it already expects this name)

OR

Simply run directly:
   python unified_stock_CLEAN.py

The file works perfectly - it just needs to match the name in the batch file.
