MD5:  ef3de248cea006ac3677d08e21996b60
Date: 2024-11-20 (Final Corrected Version)
Status: ✅ Production Ready

WHAT WAS FIXED
==============

Initial v1.3.16 Release:
- ✓ INSTALL.bat fixed (no venv, works like v1.0)
- ✓ __init__.py files present
- ✗ Had OLD overnight_pipeline.py (missing PHASE 4.5)
- ✗ Had OLD event_risk_guard.py (missing Regime Engine)
- ✗ Had OLD config (max_models=20)

Final v1.3.16 Release (Current):
- ✓ INSTALL.bat fixed (no venv, works like v1.0)
- ✓ __init__.py files present
- ✓ CORRECT overnight_pipeline.py (with PHASE 4.5)
- ✓ CORRECT event_risk_guard.py (with Regime Engine)
- ✓ CORRECT config (max_models=100)

FILES REPLACED
==============

1. models/screening/overnight_pipeline.py
   - Now has PHASE 4.5: LSTM MODEL TRAINING
   - Now has _train_lstm_models() method
   - Calls LSTM training after scoring

2. models/screening/event_risk_guard.py
   - Now has Market Regime Engine integration
   - Now has _get_regime_crash_risk() method
   - Calls regime engine in assess_batch()

3. models/config/screening_config.json
   - max_models_per_night: 100 (was 20)
   - train_all_scanned_stocks: true

VERIFICATION RESULTS
====================

Before Fix:
✗ PHASE 4.5 Code: FAILED
✗ Regime Engine Integration: FAILED
✗ Configuration: FAILED

After Fix:
✓ PHASE 4.5 Code: PASSED
✓ Regime Engine Integration: PASSED
✓ Configuration: PASSED
✓ FinBERT Bridge: PASSED
✓ File Structure: PASSED
✓ Python Packages: PASSED

ALL FEATURES INCLUDED
======================

From v1.3.15:
✓ __init__.py files (fixes import errors)
✓ Sentiment analysis works
✓ LSTM training works (PHASE 4.5)
✓ Market Regime Engine integrated
✓ Config: 100 models per night

From v1.3.16:
✓ INSTALL.bat fixed (no venv)
✓ Shows full output
✓ Completes in 5-15 minutes
✓ Works like proven v1.0 method

INSTALLATION STEPS
==================

1. Extract event_risk_guard_v1.3.16_COMPLETE.zip

2. Double-click INSTALL.bat
   - Shows full progress
   - Takes 5-15 minutes
