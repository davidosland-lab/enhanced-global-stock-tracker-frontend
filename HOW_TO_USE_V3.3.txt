========================================
FinBERT v3.3 Enhanced Charts - FIXED!
========================================

The enhanced charts are now working at localhost:5000!

WHAT WAS FIXED:
--------------
The Flask backend was looking for "finbert_charts_complete.html"
but we created "finbert_charts_enhanced.html". 

SOLUTION APPLIED:
----------------
The enhanced HTML has been copied to replace the original:
- finbert_charts_enhanced.html → finbert_charts_complete.html

HOW TO USE NOW:
--------------
1. Start your existing backend:
   python app_finbert_complete_v3.2.py

2. Open browser to:
   http://localhost:5000

3. You'll see the ENHANCED charts with:
   - Time descriptors on x-axis (hours, days, months)
   - Synchronized volume chart below price chart
   - Color-coded volume bars (green/red)
   - All features working!

ALTERNATIVE OPTIONS:
-------------------
Option 1: Use the existing v3.2 backend (RECOMMENDED)
   - Already configured and working
   - Enhanced HTML is now served automatically

Option 2: Use the new v3.3 backend
   - python app_finbert_v3.3_enhanced.py
   - Has priority loading for enhanced HTML
   - Same functionality as v3.2

FILES UPDATED:
-------------
✅ finbert_charts_complete.html (replaced with enhanced version)
✅ FinBERT_v3.2_FINAL_DEPLOYMENT/finbert_charts_complete.html
✅ Created app_finbert_v3.3_enhanced.py (optional backend)

WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
---------------
- Time labels: "10:30 AM", "Oct 28", etc. (not timestamps!)
- Volume bars: Green when price up, Red when price down
- Synchronized zoom: Both charts zoom together
- Average volume displayed
- Enhanced tooltips with volume info

========================================
IT'S WORKING NOW! Just use localhost:5000
