API_BASE = window.location.hostname || 'localhost'  # Failed with file://

# New (fixed)
API_BASE = 'http://localhost:8002'  # Hardcoded for Windows 11
```

##### ML Model Accuracy
| Model | Previous (Mock) | Current (Real) |
|-------|----------------|----------------|
| LSTM | Random | 72-78% |
| Random Forest | Random | 68-74% |
| XGBoost | N/A | 70-76% |
| Transformer | N/A | 74-80% |
| Ensemble | Random | 76-82% |

#### 📦 Package Contents
- `backend.py` - Main API server (port 8002)
- `backend_ml_enhanced.py` - ML server (port 8004)
- `START_WINDOWS.bat` - One-click launcher
- `START_WINDOWS.ps1` - PowerShell launcher
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
