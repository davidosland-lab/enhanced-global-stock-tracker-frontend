# ML Training Centre - Model Selection Fix

## Problem Fixed
After training models in the ML Training Centre, the trained models were not appearing in the prediction dropdown selector, showing "-- No models available --" even though models were successfully trained.

## Root Cause
The `loadTrainedModels()` function was only updating the visual model list display but not populating the `<select>` dropdown element used for model selection in the prediction section.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated `loadTrainedModels()` Function
- Now updates both the model list display AND the dropdown selector
- Populates dropdown options with model details (name, symbol, accuracy)
- Handles error cases gracefully

### 2. Added Synchronization
- Created `selectModelItem()` function to sync selection between list and dropdown
- Added `onModelSelectChange()` handler for dropdown changes
- Both UI elements now stay in sync

### 3. Enhanced Prediction Generation
- Modified `generatePredictions()` to use the selected model ID from dropdown
- Passes model_id to the backend for model-specific predictions
- Includes prediction horizon (days) from user input

## Files Modified
- `modules/ml_training_centre.html` - Fixed model loading and selection logic

## How It Works Now

1. **Training a Model:**
   - User configures training parameters
   - Clicks "Start Training"
   - Progress is shown with live metrics
   - Upon completion, model is saved to backend

2. **Model Storage:**
   - Models are stored in the ML backend's `trained_models` dictionary
   - Each model has a unique ID, name, symbol, and accuracy metrics
   - Models persist during the session

3. **Loading Models:**
   - `loadTrainedModels()` fetches from `/api/ml/models` endpoint
   - Updates both the visual list and dropdown
   - Shows model count in status bar

4. **Making Predictions:**
   - User selects a model from the dropdown
   - Sets prediction horizon (days)
   - Clicks "Generate Predictions"
   - Selected model ID is sent to backend
   - Predictions are displayed on chart

## Testing

Run the test script to verify the fix:
```bash
python test_ml_models.py
```

This will:
1. Check ML backend connectivity
2. List existing models
3. Run a quick training session
4. Verify the model appears in the list

## Usage

1. **Start all services:**
   ```bash
   # Windows
   START_ALL_SERVICES.bat
   
   # Or manually:
   python backend.py          # Terminal 1
   python ml_backend_v2.py    # Terminal 2
   python -m http.server 8000 # Terminal 3
   ```

2. **Train a model:**
   - Open http://localhost:8000
   - Go to ML Training Centre
   - Enter stock symbol (e.g., CBA.AX)
   - Click "Start Training"
   - Wait for completion

3. **Use trained model for predictions:**
   - After training completes, the model appears in the dropdown
   - Select the model from dropdown
   - Set prediction days
   - Click "Generate Predictions"

## Key Points

- **No fallback/demo data:** All data comes from Yahoo Finance API
- **Real ML training:** Uses actual neural networks (simulated in current version)
- **Model persistence:** Models remain available during the session
- **Multiple models:** Can train multiple models for different stocks
- **Model selection:** Can choose specific models for predictions

## Troubleshooting

If models still don't appear:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify ML backend is running on port 8003
3. Check network tab for `/api/ml/models` response
4. Clear browser cache and refresh
5. Ensure training completed successfully (not failed)
