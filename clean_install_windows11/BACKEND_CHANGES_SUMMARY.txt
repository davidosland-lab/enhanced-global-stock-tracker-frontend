BACKEND CHANGES THAT CAUSED THE ISSUES
============================================================

During the ML dropdown prediction fix commit, the backend.py file was 
unintentionally modified in ways that broke multiple frontend modules.

KEY CHANGES THAT BROKE THINGS:
-------------------------------

1. REMOVED DEFAULT VALUES FOR MARKET DATA
   Before (WORKING):
   - "volume": info.get('volume', 0),
   - "marketCap": info.get('marketCap', 0),
   - "dayHigh": info.get('dayHigh', 0),
   
   After (BROKEN):
   - "volume": info.get('volume'),
   - "marketCap": info.get('marketCap'),  
   - "dayHigh": info.get('dayHigh'),
   
   Impact: When data was missing, backend returned null instead of 0,
           causing frontend parsing errors and 404 responses.

2. ADDED DUPLICATE HEALTH ENDPOINT
   A new /api/health endpoint was added, though one might have already existed.

3. ADDED NEW ENDPOINT
   Added /api/historical/symbols endpoint (this was actually helpful)

FILES THAT WERE ALSO ADDED DURING ML FIX:
------------------------------------------
- ml_backend_complete.py (new file)
- ml_backend_true.py (new file) 
- ml_backend_v2.py (new file)
- Multiple test and fix scripts

The main issue was that these new ML backend files may have had
different configurations or dependencies than the original working
ml_backend_working.py file.

TO FIX:
-------
1. Run RESTORE_TO_WORKING_STATE.bat to revert backend.py
2. This restores all the default values (0) for missing data
3. Uses the original ml_backend_working.py if available

The ML Training Centre dropdown fix itself (in ml_training_centre.html)
is fine and doesn't need to be reverted - only the backend.py changes
were problematic.
