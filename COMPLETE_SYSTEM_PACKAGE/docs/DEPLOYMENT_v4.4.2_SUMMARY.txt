TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Issue: TensorFlow not found during training
Fix:   pip install tensorflow
       (or run INSTALL.bat again)

Issue: Training interrupted/crashed
Fix:   Just run TRAIN_LSTM_OVERNIGHT.bat again
       Successfully trained models are preserved

Issue: Models not loading after training
Fix:   Check models directory for .keras files
       Restart server: START_FINBERT.bat

Issue: Lower accuracy than expected
Fix:   May need more epochs (edit train_lstm_batch.py)
       Some stocks harder to predict (high volatility)
       Retrain after major market events

Issue: Training takes too long
Fix:   Normal for CPU (10-15 min per stock)
       GPU would be 3-5 min per stock
       Can train individual stocks: python models/train_lstm.py --symbol AAPL

================================================================================
MAINTENANCE
================================================================================

Retraining Schedule:
  ✓ Monthly: For active traders
  ✓ Quarterly: For long-term investors
  ✓ After major market events: Always recommended

To Retrain:
  1. Just run TRAIN_LSTM_OVERNIGHT.bat again
  2. Overwrites old models with new ones
  3. Restart server to load updated models
