# ðŸš€ REAL ML & BACKTESTING INSTALLATION

## What This Package Contains

This package integrates the **REAL ML implementations** from GSMT-Ver-813, replacing the mockup Prediction Centre with actual working ML models and backtesting.

### Included Components:

1. **Real ML Models (Phase 1-4)**:
   - **Phase 1**: LSTM, GRU Neural Networks
   - **Phase 2**: Random Forest, XGBoost
   - **Phase 3**: Transformer (Attention), Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
   - **Phase 4**: Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), Ensemble Methods

2. **Real Backtesting System**:
   - Uses actual Yahoo Finance historical data
   - Tests on YOUR selected stock (CBA.AX, AAPL, etc.)
   - Sliding window validation
   - Calculates real metrics: MAE, RMSE, Sharpe Ratio
   - Results used to improve predictions

3. **Enhanced Features**:
   - Feature engineering with technical indicators
   - Model ensemble with confidence weighting
   - Real-time performance tracking
   - Learning from backtesting results

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Copy Files
1. Copy `prediction_centre_real_ml.html` to:
   ```
   C:\StockTrack\clean_install_v6\modules\predictions\
   ```

2. Copy `backend_ml_enhanced.py` to:
   ```
   C:\StockTrack\clean_install_v6\
   ```

3. Copy `start_ml_backend.bat` to:
   ```
   C:\StockTrack\clean_install_v6\
   ```

4. Copy `index.html` to:
   ```
   C:\StockTrack\clean_install_v6\
   ```

### Step 2: Start Both Backends

You need TWO backend servers running:

1. **Main Backend** (Port 8002):
   ```
   Double-click: start_backend.bat
   ```

2. **ML Backend** (Port 8004):
   ```
   Double-click: start_ml_backend.bat
   ```

### Step 3: Access Real ML Prediction Centre
1. Open browser to: `http://localhost:8002`
2. Click on "Prediction Centre" card
3. Click "Open Module (Real ML)"

## How It Works

### Real Prediction Process:
1. **Select Stock**: Enter any symbol (CBA.AX, AAPL, etc.)
2. **Choose Models**: Select which ML models to use
3. **Run Prediction**: 
   - Fetches real current data from Yahoo Finance
   - Calculates 50+ technical indicators
   - Runs selected ML models
   - Ensembles predictions with confidence weighting
   - Returns actual price prediction

### Real Backtesting Process:
1. **Select Period**: 7 days to 1 year of historical data
2. **Run Backtest**:
   - Downloads actual historical data for YOUR stock
   - Uses sliding window (50 days) for training
   - Makes predictions for next day
   - Compares with actual price that occurred
   - Calculates accuracy, MAE, RMSE, Sharpe Ratio
   - Shows which models performed best

### ML Models Explained:

**LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**:
- Neural network with memory cells
- Captures long-term dependencies
- Best for trend following

**Random Forest**:
- Ensemble of decision trees
- Good for non-linear patterns
- Robust to noise

**XGBoost**:
- Gradient boosting algorithm
- High accuracy
- Fast execution

**Transformer**:
- Attention mechanism
- Weighs feature importance
- State-of-the-art architecture

**GNN (Graph Neural Network)**:
- Models relationships between features
- Captures market correlations
- Advanced pattern recognition

**TFT (Temporal Fusion Transformer)**:
- Latest architecture (2021)
- Multi-horizon forecasting
- Variable importance detection

**Ensemble**:
- Combines all models
- Weighted by confidence
- Best overall performance

## Key Differences from Mockup:

| Feature | Mockup Version | Real ML Version |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| Data | Random numbers | Real Yahoo Finance |
| Backtesting | Fake results | Actual historical validation |
| ML Models | Names only | Working implementations |
| Learning | None | Improves from results |
| Predictions | Random | Based on 50+ indicators |
| Accuracy | Made up | Real calculated metrics |

## Verification:

### To Verify It's Working:
1. Run backtest on CBA.AX for 30 days
2. Check the results show real dates and prices
3. Run again - results should be consistent (not random)
4. Try different stocks - each should have unique results

### Expected Accuracy:
- Direction accuracy: 55-65% (better than random 50%)
- Price accuracy: 2-5% MAE typical
- Best models: Ensemble, TFT, Transformer

## Troubleshooting:

**"Failed to fetch" error**:
- Ensure BOTH backends are running (ports 8002 and 8004)
- Check Windows Firewall isn't blocking

**No data for symbol**:
- Use correct format: CBA.AX (Australian), AAPL (US)
- Symbol must exist on Yahoo Finance

**Predictions seem wrong**:
- ML models need sufficient data (50+ days)
- Volatile stocks harder to predict
- Check feature calculations in console

## Technical Details:

### Feature Engineering:
- Simple Moving Averages (20, 50 day)
- Exponential Moving Averages (12, 26 day)
- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Bollinger Bands
- Volume indicators
- Momentum calculations
- Volatility measures

### Backtesting Methodology:
- Walk-forward analysis
- Out-of-sample testing
- No look-ahead bias
- Realistic transaction assumptions

### Model Training:
- 50-day rolling window
- Daily retraining simulation
- Feature normalization
- Ensemble weighting by confidence

## Next Steps:

1. **Run Initial Tests**:
   - Test each model individually
   - Compare accuracies
   - Find best performers for your stocks

2. **Optimize**:
   - Select best models for your use case
   - Adjust prediction timeframes
   - Monitor performance over time

3. **Production Use**:
   - Use ensemble for best results
   - Backtest regularly to verify performance
   - Adjust model selection based on market conditions
