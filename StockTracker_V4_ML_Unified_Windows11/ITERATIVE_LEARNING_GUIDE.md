# Iterative Learning Guide - How Models Improve Over Time

## ðŸ§  **YES, Models DO Learn from Previous Training!**

The ML backend implements sophisticated iterative learning that allows models to improve with each training session. Here's how it works:

## ðŸ“Š Key Learning Mechanisms

### 1. **Transfer Learning**
When you train a model for the same stock symbol again, the system:
- **Loads the previous best model** for that symbol and model type
- **Transfers learned parameters** to the new training session
- **Fine-tunes** rather than starting from scratch
- **Preserves valuable patterns** discovered in previous sessions

### 2. **Knowledge Base Persistence**
The system maintains a persistent knowledge base that stores:
- **Discovered patterns** from all training sessions
- **Feature importance scores** from previous models
- **Success rates** of different pattern types
- **Confidence levels** for each learned pattern

### 3. **Progressive Model Complexity**
With each training iteration:
- **Random Forest**: Increases trees (50 â†’ 80 â†’ 110...) and depth (10 â†’ 12 â†’ 14...)
- **Gradient Boosting**: Adjusts learning rate and estimators progressively
- **Feature Engineering**: Adds patterns discovered from previous training

### 4. **Model Versioning & Lineage**
Every trained model is tracked with:
- **Version numbers** (v1, v2, v3...)
- **Parent model reference** (which model it learned from)
- **Performance improvement percentage** over previous version
- **Best model flagging** for each symbol

## ðŸ”„ How Iterative Learning Works

### First Training Session (Version 1)
```
1. Train from scratch with base features
2. Discover important patterns
3. Save model and patterns to knowledge base
4. Mark as "best model" for this symbol
```

### Second Training Session (Version 2)
```
1. Load Version 1 model and its patterns
2. Apply transfer learning from Version 1
3. Add newly discovered patterns as features
4. Train with enhanced feature set
5. If better than v1, mark as new "best model"
```

### Third+ Training Sessions (Version 3+)
```
1. Load best performing model (v1 or v2)
2. Include ALL previously discovered patterns
3. Use cumulative knowledge for feature engineering
4. Progressive complexity increase
5. Only replace "best model" if performance improves
```

## ðŸ“ˆ What Improves With Each Training

### 1. **Pattern Recognition**
- Each session discovers new patterns
- Patterns with >60% confidence are retained
- Future models use these patterns as additional features
- Example: "When RSI > 70 and volume spike > 2x, price often drops"

### 2. **Feature Importance Learning**
- System tracks which features matter most
- Top 5 features from each session are stored
- Future models prioritize important features
- Less important features may be dropped

### 3. **Model Parameters**
- Successful parameters are transferred to new models
- Learning rate, tree depth, etc. are optimized based on history
- Poor performing parameters are avoided

### 4. **Error Correction**
- System analyzes prediction errors from previous models
- Identifies systematic biases
- Adjusts new models to correct these biases

## ðŸ“Š Database Tables for Learning

### `model_registry`
- Stores all model versions with lineage
- Tracks parent_model_id for transfer learning
- Records performance scores for comparison

### `knowledge_base`
- Persistent storage of discovered patterns
- Patterns survive across sessions
- Confidence scores updated with validation

### `training_history`
- Detailed log of each training iteration
- Tracks improvement over baseline
- Shows learning curve progression

### `feature_history`
- Records important features from each model
- Helps identify consistently important indicators
- Used to enhance future feature engineering

## ðŸŽ¯ Practical Examples

### Example 1: Training AAPL Three Times

**Session 1:**
- Accuracy: 82%
- Discovers: "High volume on Monday matters"
- Saves as best model

**Session 2:**
- Loads Session 1 model
- Adds Monday volume as feature
- Accuracy: 85% (+3% improvement)
- Discovers: "EMA crossover pattern"
- Becomes new best model

**Session 3:**
- Loads Session 2 model
- Uses both Monday volume AND EMA crossover
- Accuracy: 87% (+2% improvement)
- Cumulative improvement: +5%

### Example 2: Different Model Types

If you train different model types (LSTM, then Random Forest, then XGBoost):
- Each model type maintains its own lineage
- But ALL models share the discovered patterns
- Knowledge base is cumulative across all models

## ðŸ’¡ Best Practices for Iterative Learning

### 1. **Train Same Symbol Multiple Times**
```
Train AAPL â†’ Train AAPL again â†’ Train AAPL again
Each session builds on the previous
```

### 2. **Use Same Model Type for Transfer Learning**
```
Random Forest v1 â†’ Random Forest v2 â†’ Random Forest v3
Direct parameter transfer works best with same model type
```

### 3. **Allow Sufficient Data Between Sessions**
```
Wait for new market data (days/weeks) between training
Fresh data helps validate and improve patterns
```

### 4. **Monitor Version Performance**
```
Check Models tab to see improvement trajectory
If performance plateaus, try different model type
```

## ðŸš€ How to Use in Unified ML Centre

### Training for Iterative Learning:
1. **First Training**: Train a model for your symbol (e.g., AAPL with LSTM)
2. **Check Performance**: Note the accuracy in Models tab
3. **Train Again**: Use same symbol and model type
4. **Observe Improvement**: New model should show better accuracy
5. **View History**: Models tab shows all versions with improvements

### The System Automatically:
- Detects previous models for the same symbol
- Loads best performing version
- Applies transfer learning
- Uses discovered patterns
- Tracks improvement percentage

## ðŸ“‰ When Models DON'T Improve

Sometimes a new version might not improve because:
- Market conditions have changed significantly
- Maximum learnable patterns already discovered
- Overfitting on historical data
- Need for different model type

In these cases, the system:
- Keeps the previous best model active
- Doesn't replace it with worse performing version
- Suggests trying different model types

## ðŸ”¬ Technical Implementation

### Transfer Learning Code:
```python
# System automatically does this when retraining:
previous_best = load_previous_best_model(symbol, model_type)
if previous_best:
    model = transfer_learning(previous_best, new_data)
    # Starts from previous knowledge, not scratch
```

### Pattern Discovery:
```python
# Top features become permanent patterns:
if feature_importance > 0.1:
    save_to_knowledge_base(pattern)
    # Future models will use this pattern
```

### Progressive Complexity:
```python
# Each iteration increases model capacity:
iteration_1: n_estimators = 50
iteration_2: n_estimators = 80  
iteration_3: n_estimators = 110
# More capacity to learn complex patterns
```

## ðŸŽ“ Summary

**YES, the system DOES learn from previous attempts!** Each training session:
1. **Builds on previous best model** (transfer learning)
2. **Uses cumulative discovered patterns** (knowledge base)
3. **Increases model complexity progressively**
4. **Tracks and maintains model lineage**
5. **Only replaces models that actually improve**

The more you train the same symbol, the better the model becomes at predicting that specific stock's behavior, as it accumulates knowledge about that stock's unique patterns and characteristics.
