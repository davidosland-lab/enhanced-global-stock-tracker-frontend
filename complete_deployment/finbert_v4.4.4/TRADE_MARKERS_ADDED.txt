  FinBERT v4.4.4 - TRADE BUY/SELL MARKERS ADDED TO EQUITY CURVE
================================================================================

GREAT NEWS - EQUITY CURVE IS NOW SHOWING!
------------------------------------------
From your console output:
✅ Chart rendered successfully
✅ Data received: 253 data points
✅ Date range: Nov 6, 24 to Nov 5, 25
✅ Value range: $9,999.17 to $10,186.78

WHAT I'VE ADDED NOW:
--------------------
✅ BUY/SELL markers overlaid on the equity curve showing:
   - ▲ Green up arrow = BUY (when trade opened)
   - ▼ Red/Green down arrow = SELL (when trade closed)
     - Green if profit
     - Red if loss
   - Amount shown above each marker

✅ Markers extracted from performance.charts.trade_distribution
✅ Each marker shows:
   - Entry date and entry price (BUY)
   - Exit date, exit price, and P&L amount (SELL)

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
1. After equity curve renders, code checks for trade_distribution data
2. Extracts all trades from distribution buckets:
   - large_win_details, medium_win_details, small_win_details
   - small_loss_details, medium_loss_details, large_loss_details
3. For each trade, creates markers:
   - BUY marker at entry_date showing investment amount
   - SELL marker at exit_date showing profit/loss
4. Overlays markers on equity curve using ECharts markPoint

CONSOLE OUTPUT TO EXPECT:
--------------------------
✅ "Trade distribution data: {...}"
✅ "Extracted X trades from distribution"
✅ "Adding X trade markers to chart"
✅ "Buy markers: X Sell markers: X"

VISUAL RESULT:
--------------
You should see:
📈 Green equity line showing portfolio value growth
▲ Green up arrows at points where stocks were bought
▼ Arrows at points where stocks were sold:
  - Green down arrow if trade was profitable
  - Red down arrow if trade lost money
💰 Dollar amounts shown above sell markers

INSTALL AND TEST:
-----------------
1. Extract: FinBERT_v4.4.4_WITH_TRADE_MARKERS_20251106_074100.zip
2. Run: INSTALL.bat
3. Run: START_FINBERT.bat
4. Press F12 → Console (watch for marker messages)
5. Run backtest on CBA.AX (or any stock)
6. Check chart for buy/sell arrows

NOTE ABOUT YOUR CURRENT DATA:
------------------------------
From your console output, I noticed:
- positions_value: 0 throughout
- This suggests NO TRADES were executed in that backtest
- Might be because:
  1. Model confidence was too low (didn't generate buy signals)
  2. Date range didn't trigger any trades
  3. Symbol had insufficient data

If you see NO markers, check console for:
"No trades to mark on chart" or "Extracted 0 trades"

This means the backtest completed but the model didn't generate
any buy/sell signals. Try:
- Different stock symbol
- Longer date range
- Lower confidence threshold in backtest settings
