## 1. CORE ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS

### 1.1 Model Selection Priority (Based on Research)
Research shows these models consistently perform best for stock prediction:

**Primary Models (Implement First):**
1. **XGBoost** - Best overall performance in comparative studies
   - Handles non-linearity well
   - Fast training (10-30 seconds typical)
   - Excellent with technical indicators
   - Performance: 60-75% directional accuracy typical

2. **Random Forest** - Close second, more interpretable
   - Robust to overfitting
   - Feature importance built-in
   - Performance: 58-72% directional accuracy

3. **LSTM** - Best for capturing temporal patterns
   - Excellent for volatility prediction
   - Requires more data (minimum 2 years)
   - Performance: 55-70% directional accuracy

**Secondary Models (Add Later):**
4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** - Good for regime detection
5. **Neural Networks (MLP)** - Ensemble component
6. **Gradient Boosting** - Alternative to XGBoost

### 1.2 Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
```
Ensemble Model = 0.4*XGBoost + 0.3*RandomForest + 0.3*LSTM
```

## 2. FEATURE ENGINEERING FRAMEWORK

### 2.1 Essential Technical Indicators (Research-Validated)
Based on analysis of 138 papers, these are the most predictive features:

**Tier 1 (Must Have):**
```python
ESSENTIAL_FEATURES = {
    'price_based': [
        'returns',           # Daily returns
        'log_returns',       # Log returns
        'sma_20', 'sma_50', 'sma_200',  # Moving averages
        'ema_12', 'ema_26'   # Exponential MAs
    ],
    'momentum': [
        'rsi_14',            # RSI (14-day)
        'macd', 'macd_signal', 'macd_histogram'
    ],
    'volatility': [
        'bb_upper', 'bb_lower', 'bb_width',  # Bollinger Bands
        'atr_14',            # Average True Range
        'volatility_20'      # 20-day volatility
    ],
    'volume': [
        'volume_ratio',      # Volume/20-day avg
        'obv',              # On-Balance Volume
        'mfi'               # Money Flow Index
    ]
}
```

**Tier 2 (Performance Enhancers):**
- Stochastic oscillator
- Williams %R
- Commodity Channel Index (CCI)
- Aroon indicators
- Pattern recognition (doji, hammer, etc.)

### 2.2 Feature Count Guidelines
- **Optimal range**: 20-50 features
- **Too few** (<10): Misses important signals
- **Too many** (>100): Overfitting risk
- Use feature importance ranking to select top 30-40

## 3. DATA ARCHITECTURE & OPTIMIZATION

### 3.1 SQLite Caching System (50x Speed Improvement)

**Implementation Strategy:**
```python
class HistoricalDataCache:
    """
    SQLite cache for historical stock data
    Achieves 50x faster retrieval vs API calls
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.db_path = "stock_cache.db"
        self.cache_duration = 86400  # 24 hours
        
    schema = """
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS stock_data (
        symbol TEXT,
        date TEXT,
        open REAL,
        high REAL,
        low REAL,
        close REAL,
        volume INTEGER,
        hash TEXT UNIQUE,
        cached_at TIMESTAMP,
        PRIMARY KEY (symbol, date)
    );
    
    CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_symbol_date 
    ON stock_data(symbol, date);
    
    CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS features_cache (
        symbol TEXT,
        date TEXT,
        feature_set TEXT,
        feature_data BLOB,  -- Pickled numpy array
        cached_at TIMESTAMP,
        PRIMARY KEY (symbol, date, feature_set)
    );
    """
```

**Performance Metrics:**
- API call: ~2-5 seconds per symbol
- SQLite cache: ~0.05-0.1 seconds per symbol
- **Result**: 20-100x faster data retrieval

### 3.2 Data Pipeline Optimization
1. **Batch Processing**: Fetch multiple symbols simultaneously
2. **Incremental Updates**: Only fetch new data points
3. **Feature Pre-computation**: Cache calculated indicators
4. **Memory Management**: Use generators for large datasets

    'min_samples_leaf': [2, 4]
}
```

**LSTM Architecture:**
```python
LSTM_CONFIG = {
    'layers': 2,  # Research shows 2-3 layers optimal
    'units': [50, 25],  # Decreasing units per layer
    'dropout': 0.2,
    'lookback': 20,  # 20 days historical window
