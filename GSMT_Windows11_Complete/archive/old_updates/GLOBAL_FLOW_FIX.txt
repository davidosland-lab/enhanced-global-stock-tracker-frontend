====================================================================

CORRECT IMPLEMENTATION - GLOBAL MARKET FLOW VIEW

WHAT WAS FIXED:
--------------
✓ Australian markets (ASX) ALWAYS display when they have traded
✓ Currently open markets show data from open to CURRENT TIME  
✓ Markets not yet opened do NOT display
✓ 5-minute data resolution for detailed movements
✓ Proper global flow visualization from Asia → Europe → Americas

EXAMPLE at 11:49 PM AEST (29/09/25):
------------------------------------
^AXJO (ASX 200):
  ✓ DISPLAYS: Full trading session (10:00 AM - 4:00 PM)
  ✓ Status: CLOSED (completed market shows all data)
  
^FTSE (FTSE 100):  
  ✓ DISPLAYS: From 5:00 PM to 11:49 PM only
  ✓ Status: TRADING (shows data up to current time)
  ✓ No future data beyond 11:49 PM
  
^GSPC (S&P 500):
  ✓ NO DISPLAY: Market hasn't opened yet
  ✓ Status: PRE-MARKET (opens at 11:30 PM)
  ✓ Will start displaying after it opens

KEY LOGIC:
----------
The tracker shows the FLOW of global markets throughout the day:

1. COMPLETED MARKETS: Show full trading session
   - Markets that have finished trading display complete data
   - Example: ASX at 11 PM shows full 10 AM - 4 PM session

2. CURRENTLY TRADING: Show from open to current time
   - Active markets display data up to the present moment
   - Example: FTSE at 11:49 PM shows 5 PM - 11:49 PM

3. NOT YET STARTED: No display
   - Markets that haven't opened show no data
   - Example: S&P before 11:30 PM shows nothing
