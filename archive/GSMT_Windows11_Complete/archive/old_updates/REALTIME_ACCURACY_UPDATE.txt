GLOBAL INDICES TRACKER - REAL-TIME ACCURACY UPDATE v4.0
====================================================================
Date: September 29, 2025

CRITICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

1. REAL-TIME MARKET STATUS ACCURACY
   ✓ Markets that haven't opened yet DO NOT display any data
   ✓ Currently open markets show data ONLY up to current time

2. 5-MINUTE DATA RESOLUTION
   ✓ Chart now plots data every 5 minutes (288 points per day)
   ✓ More detailed movement visualization
   ✓ Better captures intraday volatility
   ✓ Smoother, more accurate trend lines

3. TIME-AWARE DATA DISPLAY
   ✓ At 11:49 PM AEST on current day:
     - ASX (^AXJO): Shows full day (10 AM - 4 PM) - CLOSED
     - FTSE: Shows from 5 PM to 11:49 PM - STILL OPEN
     - S&P 500: NO DATA - Market opens at 11:30 PM
