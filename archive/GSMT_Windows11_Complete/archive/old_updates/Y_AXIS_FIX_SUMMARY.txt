Y-AXIS SCALING FIX - COMPLETED
====================================================================

PROBLEM FIXED:
- Y-axis was showing extreme scaling making the chart unviewable
- Chart required scrolling due to excessive height
- Percentage values were not properly constrained

SOLUTIONS IMPLEMENTED:
1. Added suggestedMin: -5 and suggestedMax: 5 to Y-axis configuration
2. Fixed chart container height to 400px (canvas: 320px)
3. Added dynamic scaling with reasonable limits (-10% to +10% max)
4. Reduced data points from 96 to 24 (hourly instead of 15-min)
5. Added stepSize: 1 for cleaner Y-axis tick marks
6. Constrained random variations to Â±0.3% for realistic intraday changes

KEY CHANGES IN CODE:
--------------------
Y-Axis Configuration:
  suggestedMin: -5,
  suggestedMax: 5,
  ticks: {
      stepSize: 1,
      font: { size: 10 }
  }

Dynamic Range Calculation:
  mainChart.options.scales.y.min = Math.max(-10, Math.floor(minValue - padding));
  mainChart.options.scales.y.max = Math.min(10, Math.ceil(maxValue + padding));

Container Styling:
  .chart-container { height: 400px; }
  #mainChart { height: 320px; }

Data Generation:
  const variation = (Math.random() - 0.5) * 0.3;  // Smaller variations
  const dataPoint = Math.max(-10, Math.min(10, baseChange + variation));  // Capped

VISUAL IMPROVEMENTS:
- Chart now fits perfectly without scrolling
- Y-axis shows reasonable percentage range
- Zero line clearly visible as reference
- Smooth curves with realistic market movements
- Cleaner layout with optimized spacing

FILE UPDATES:
- indices_tracker_percentage.html - Main tracker (fixed)
- indices_tracker_fixed_scaling.html - Backup of fixed version
- GSMT_IndicesTracker_Update_v2.1_FIXED.zip - Updated package (25KB)

TO USE:
1. Extract GSMT_IndicesTracker_Update_v2.1_FIXED.zip
2. Run UPDATE_INDICES_ENHANCED.cmd
3. Launch with LAUNCH_INDICES_TRACKER.cmd

The chart will now display properly with:
- No scrolling required
- Clear percentage scale from -5% to +5% (auto-adjusts if needed)
- All data visible in fixed 400px height
- Professional appearance with realistic market movements
