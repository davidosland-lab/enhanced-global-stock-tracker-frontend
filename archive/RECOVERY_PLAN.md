## A. STOP ALL CURRENT WORK
✅ Stopping all development
✅ Documenting current state
✅ Preserving working backend

## B. IDENTIFY WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS
- ✅ Backend API on port 8000: Returns REAL Yahoo Finance data
- ✅ Endpoints working:
  - GET /api/indices - All market indices with real data
  - GET /api/indices/{symbol}/history - Historical data
  - GET /api/market-status - Market trading status
- ❌ Frontend: All broken due to overengineering

## C. CREATE ONE SIMPLE HTML FILE
Requirements:
1. Fetch real data from localhost:8000
2. Display it correctly
3. Have working links to modules
4. NO SYNTHETIC DATA
5. Test before claiming complete
