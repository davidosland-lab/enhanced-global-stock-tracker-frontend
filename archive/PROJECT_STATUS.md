### 🔗 **Live URLs**

#### **Local Development** (Currently Running)
- **Frontend**: https://3000-i2ch499gc6d7qpm0yvxy4-6532622b.e2b.dev
- **Backend API**: https://8000-i2ch499gc6d7qpm0yvxy4-6532622b.e2b.dev
- **API Docs**: https://8000-i2ch499gc6d7qpm0yvxy4-6532622b.e2b.dev/api/docs

#### **Production Deployments**
- **Frontend**: Netlify (auto-deploys from main branch)
- **Backend**: https://web-production-68eaf.up.railway.app

### ✅ **Issues Fixed**

1. **Navigation Links** - All module links now working correctly
   - PR #1: https://github.com/davidosland-lab/enhanced-global-stock-tracker-frontend/pull/1
   - Updated netlify.toml and _redirects with proper routing
   - Fixed paths in index.html

2. **Project Structure** - Combined frontend and backend for easier development
   - Both repositories now in single workspace
   - Can work on full stack without switching

3. **API Configuration** - Added smart backend switching
   - Auto-detects local vs production environment
   - Includes retry logic and error handling

### 📊 **Backend Features Active**

The backend is running with:
- ✅ Phase 1 Critical Fixes (P1_001-P1_004)
- ✅ Phase 2 Architecture Optimization (P2_001-P2_004)
- ✅ Phase 3 Extended Unified Super Predictor (P3_001-P3_007)
- ✅ Phase 4 Graph Neural Networks (GNN)
- ⚠️ Phase 4 TFT (Limited - missing PyTorch due to space)
- ✅ ASX SPI Prediction System
- ✅ CBA Enhanced Prediction System
- ✅ Intraday Prediction System
- ✅ Multi-source data service (Yahoo Finance active)

### 🎯 **Ready for Module Testing**

The system is now ready for you to:
1. Test each module individually
2. Verify API endpoints are working
3. Check data flows between frontend and backend
4. Identify specific issues in each component

### 📝 **Next Steps**

1. **Merge PR #1** to deploy navigation fixes to production
2. **Test modules one by one** starting with:
   - Enhanced Global Market Tracker
   - Single Stock Track & Predict
   - Prediction Performance Dashboard
   - Advanced Dashboard
3. **Fix any module-specific issues** as we identify them
4. **Optimize performance** where needed

### 🛠️ **Quick Commands**

```bash
# View backend logs
cd /home/user/webapp
./dev.sh  # Uses remote backend

# Check API health
curl https://8000-i2ch499gc6d7qpm0yvxy4-6532622b.e2b.dev/api/health

# View API documentation
# Open: https://8000-i2ch499gc6d7qpm0yvxy4-6532622b.e2b.dev/api/docs
```

### ⚠️ **Known Limitations**

1. **PyTorch not installed** - Phase 4 TFT features limited due to space constraints
2. **Some dependencies missing** - Only essential packages installed
3. **Backend runs locally** - Full Railway deployment has more resources
