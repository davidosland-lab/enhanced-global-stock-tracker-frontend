v1.3.16 (2024-11-20) - INSTALL.bat Fixed
=========================================

CRITICAL FIX: Installation Method

Changes:
- ✓ Rewrote INSTALL.bat to match working v1.0 method
- ✓ Removed virtual environment (venv) creation
- ✓ Installs to user site-packages (like v1.0)
- ✓ Shows full pip output (no more silent hangs)
- ✓ Uses requirements.txt (proven approach)
- ✓ Completes in 5-15 minutes (no 10-minute timeout)

Issues Fixed:
- ✗ INSTALL.bat hanging at "Attempting batch installation..."
- ✗ Silent installation with no progress indication
- ✗ 10-minute timeout causing installation failure

Previous Fixes Retained:
- ✓ __init__.py files (from v1.3.15)
- ✓ System32 detection
- ✓ Package verification
- ✓ All documentation

Installation Method:
- NO virtual environment
- Direct user package installation
- Full output visible
- Based on proven v1.0 approach


v1.3.15 (2024-11-20) - Python Package Structure Fix
====================================================

CRITICAL FIX: Import Errors

Changes:
- ✓ Added finbert_v4.4.4/__init__.py (127 bytes)
- ✓ Added finbert_v4.4.4/models/__init__.py (105 bytes)
- ✓ Fixed INSTALL.bat with System32 detection
- ✓ Added full path to venv python
- ✓ Individual package installation with retry logic

Issues Fixed:
- ✗ ERROR - No module named 'models.finbert_sentiment'
- ✗ ERROR - No module named 'models.train_lstm'
- ✗ Sentiment Analysis: 0 articles for all stocks
- ✗ LSTM Training: 0/100 models trained

Result:
- ✓ Sentiment analysis functional
- ✓ LSTM training functional
- ✓ All features operational

Installation Issues:
- ✗ INSTALL.bat used venv and hung (FIXED in v1.3.16)
